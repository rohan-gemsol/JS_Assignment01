Assignment 1:

 

Create a js file and include it in the html file which can run on the browser.

In the js file, create a self - invoked function which will dynamically create a table with 5 rows and 5 columns which consists of your basic personal information like :

 

Name

Age

DOB 

Email

Company

 

Note:

1. Use the dynamic DOM handling functions we studied in the last session like createElement, text nodes and element nodes.

2. The data inside each <td> for your information should be a text node.

3. The code should be properly formatted and readable.

4. The labels Name, Age, etc should be in bold font with dynamic CSS.

5. No static HTML or CSS should be written in the html file.
